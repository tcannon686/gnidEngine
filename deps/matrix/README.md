# Matrix
This is a simple library I made to do basic vector and matrix math. I
have used it in some of my other projects, including my raytracer. To use it,
just copy the C and header file over to your project, or alternatively the
`matrix.hpp` file if you're using C++. You may need to link with `-lm` on linux,
but other than that I've had no issues linking with MinGW or Visual Studio. To
use the C++ version, simply include `matrix.hpp`, which supports matrices and
vectors of all sizes, and uses templates.
