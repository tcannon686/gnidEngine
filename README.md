# gnidEngine
gnidEngine is a simple game engine I have been developing in C++. Goals for the
project include clean code, fast runtime, and good documentation. I haven't used
it for any projects yet, but hopefully something useful will come from it. The
target platform is Linux, but it should be portable and work with most OSs.

## Compiling
To compile, install the dependencies, then run `make`. You can also build the docs
by running `doxygen Doxyfile`.

### Dependencies
 - GLFW3
 - OpenGL

### Ubuntu
To install the dependencies on ubuntu, run the following:
```
sudo apt install libmesa-common-dev
sudo apt install libglfw3
```

## Running
To run, you will need to have a game set up. There is a separate repository for
this.

## TODO
 - Switch to CMake
